## Spigot mappings in tiny V1



## Legality
The actual legality of distrubuting the Spigot mappings are dubious at best. See this forum post [her](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/an-open-letter-change-the-license-of-spigot-obfuscation-mappings-to-some-open-source-license.489027/) for more details. Since the Spigot mappings were derived from the Bukkit mappings, the copyright _may_ not be fully "SpigotMC Pty. Ltd", and so is partly owned by Mojang? 


So, consider all the tiny_v1 files here **proprietary**! All files here (except the python files) are
```
(c) 2014-2026 SpigotMC Pty. Ltd.
```

If anybody from Spigot wants this taken down, make an issue and I will happily do so.
